# Spylock

Spylock used a shoulder-surfing proof pin-entry method to help users lock apps on their smartphones. I learned Kotlin and the entire Android development suite, including billing. I also learned a lot about UX/UI design via this project.

Spylock might still be on the Play Store:

## Lessons Learned

I killed SpyLock after 5 months (including learning and development) because the bulk of the user traction came from teenagers who do not have the desire to pay for this kind of service. I was not interested in an advertising-based funding model.
