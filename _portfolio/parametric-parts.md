# Parametric Parts

I designed a set of libraries in OpenScad allowing to quickly design 3D printable robotic parts for the Poppy Project.

Poppy creatures are built from [XL320 motors](http://support.robotis.com/en/product/dynamixel/xl-series/xl-320.htm) from [Robotis](http://en.robotis.com/). Motors are linked together with [parametrable frames](https://github.com/jgrizou/robotis-scad) that I designed with [OpenScad](http://www.openscad.org/). The resulting robots are controlled using the [pypot library](https://github.com/poppy-project/pypot), typically running on a Raspberry Pi. These robots aim at being low cost and easy to modify.

## Libraries

OpenScad libraries for parametric parts:

- [robotis-scad](https://github.com/jgrizou/robotis-scad)
- [segment-scad](https://github.com/jgrizou/segment-scad)
- [lego-scad](https://github.com/jgrizou/lego-scad)
- [raspberry-scad](https://github.com/jgrizou/raspberry-scad)

## Robots

Example of robots made with the parametric part libraries:

- [poppy-multipod-mini](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-multipod-mini)
- [poppy-snake-mini](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-snake-mini)
- [poppy-4wheels-mini](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-4wheels-mini)
- [poppy-dragster-mini](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-dragster-mini)

The [poppy-ergo-jr](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-jr) and [poppy-ergo-starter](https://github.com/poppy-project/poppy-ergo-starter) robots started with parametric parts. Their latest version is now made with [onshape](https://www.onshape.com/) by [Matthieu Lapeyre](https://github.com/matthieu-lapeyre). See the hardware/README.md file of each repo to find back the openscad version.
