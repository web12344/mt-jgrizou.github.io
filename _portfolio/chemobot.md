# Applying Machine Learning to the Exploration of Physicochemical Systems

_Last update: January 2019_

*How can AI help make discoveries on the bench in a chemistry lab? How can chemical systems help devise better AI algorithms?*  
I explored those questions with the team I led in the [Cronin Group](http://www.chem.gla.ac.uk/cronin/). The group’s cutting-edge knowledge combined with my experience from the developmental sciences allowed us to bring innovative ideas to the field, including the use of active learning, curiosity-driven exploration, and human comparative studies.

## Approach

I grew frustrated that most AI research was done on simulated environments. I wanted to see this technology used in the real world on systems we do not ourselves design nor understand – that is, not even on robots.

The physical sciences seem fitting. In physics, chemistry, or biology, an important part of everyday research is to understand yet unknown systems. Scientists devise experiments and build instruments to query these systems with the aim of modeling, and later predicting, their evolution.

This is in sharp contrast with simulation, big data, and controlled robotic problems AI algorithms are designed on and for.  
[1] If we ought to bring AI advances to experimental research in labs, we need to drop the habit of thinking that experiments are free, unlimited, and well-defined.

### Connecting Developmental Robotics and Physical Sciences

A subfield of robotics, called [developmental robotics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Developmental_robotics), imposes similar constraints. Their aim is to build a robot that can learn like a child. This opened an ocean of research directions to bring principles from developmental robotics into the physical sciences.

_The Chemobot team from 2015–2018 within the Cronin group, University of Glasgow. Missing: Kevin Donkers._

The team was composed of Lee Cronin (PI), Jonathan Grizou (me), Abhishek Sharma, Jan Szymanski, James W. Taylor, Juan Manuel Parrilla Gutierrez, Laurie J. Points, Vasilios Duros, Sergio Martin Marti, Graham Keenan, and Kevin Donkers. A mix of chemists, computer scientists, and material scientists.

### Curiosity-Driven Exploration of Oil-in-Water Droplets

The [Dropfactory robot](https://github.com/croningp/dropfactory) is able to perform, record, and clean 8 droplet experiments in parallel.

By applying the CA-robot to the study of self-propelling multicomponent oil-in-water droplets, we observed an order of magnitude more variety of droplet behaviors than possible with a random parameter search given the same budget. We discovered a sudden and highly specific response of droplets to slight temperature changes.
