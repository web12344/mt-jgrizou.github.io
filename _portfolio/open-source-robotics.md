### Open source robotics
_Last update: January 2019_

*Robots are coming! Or so they say. I have been interested in robotics for as long as I can remember. Over the years, I struggled my way through the understanding of all technical parts of robot building. And once I became an expert, I grew frustrated by how unnecessarily painful it was to put a robot together. With some friends and colleagues, we have decided to take our part into making robotics more accessible. Below are our attempts, from an open source robotics community of makers, artists, educators, and scientists, to accessible tools for chemists, we even created a start-up.*

### Approach
In all projects presented below, we strived to develop empowering tools, both software and hardware, that reduce the complexity required for developing robotic devices. But we did not stop there.

We relentlessly worked to make these tools accessible to all. Our creations are available online for free and with documentation. We also provided demonstrations of our technology in various application domains, from art to science, with one of our projects seeing significant development in school education in France.

On a personal level, I have learned that technology alone can’t make an impact. It needs to be embedded into meaningful products that make what was previously impossible possible, or inaccessible accessible, in our everyday lives.

### Team
The [Poppy Project](https://jgrizou.github.io/website/projects/open_robotics/#poppy-project) was initiated by Matthieu Lapeyre, Pierre Rouanet, and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer while at INRIA. Didier Roy joined and developed the Poppy Education project, which was introduced to many schools in France. I was part of the founding team and was very active during the period 2012–2016.

The [laboratory robotics work](https://jgrizou.github.io/website/projects/open_robotics/#laboratory-robotics) was developed while I worked as a research associate and team leader in a chemistry lab (2015–2017). See the [associated project page](https://jgrizou.github.io/website/projects/chemobot) for more info.

The start-up [Pollen Robotics](https://jgrizou.github.io/website/projects/open_robotics/#start-up) was co-founded by Matthieu Lapeyre, Pierre Rouanet, Nicolas Rabault, and myself. I acted as COO and departed for new adventures in 2018.

### Projects

#### Poppy Project

##### History
The [Poppy Project](https://www.poppy-project.org/en/) was born in 2012 in the Flowers Laboratory at INRIA Bordeaux Sud-Ouest. It was initiated during Matthieu Lapeyre’s PhD Thesis supervised by Pierre-Yves Oudeyer. At the beginning, the development team included Matthieu Lapeyre (mechanics & design), Pierre Rouanet (software), and myself (electronics).

The project grew into an international open-source initiative and gathered a [community](https://forum.poppy-project.org/) of makers, artists, educators, and scientists.

Our robots were later used in a national education program to teach robotics and programming in schools. Didier Roy and Pierre-Yves Oudeyer led this effort, forming the [Poppy Education](https://www.poppy-education.org/) project at INRIA. This effort gained national recognition, resulting in the creation of an independent educator association, [Poppy Station](https://www.poppystation.org/).

*Fun fact:* Our Humanoid robot met François Hollande, the President of France.
