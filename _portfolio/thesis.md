## Abstract  

In this thesis, I investigated how autonomous robots can explore and learn models of their interaction with the environment. Leveraging curiosity-driven exploration strategies, robots can adaptively select actions to maximize learning in high-dimensional sensorimotor spaces.  

The research introduced algorithms to address the challenges of exploration and learning in high-dimensional robotic systems. Through simulations and real-world experiments, the methods demonstrated robust generalization and adaptability to new tasks and environments.  

## Contributions  

### 1. Curiosity-Driven Exploration  

Curiosity-driven learning allows robots to focus exploration on parts of the environment with higher uncertainty or potential for learning. This mechanism enables efficient use of exploration resources.
