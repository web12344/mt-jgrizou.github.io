## Abstract  

This thesis explores how robots can autonomously discover their sensorimotor space and develop models of their interaction with the environment. By leveraging intrinsic motivations, such as curiosity, robots can guide their exploration to maximize their learning efficiency.  

The thesis demonstrates how curiosity-driven algorithms allow robots to select actions that optimize their learning, especially in high-dimensional spaces. The methods are evaluated on various robotic platforms and environments, showing their ability to generalize and adapt to complex tasks.  

## Overview of Contributions  

1. **Curiosity-Driven Exploration**
